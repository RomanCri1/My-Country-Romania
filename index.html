                <p>Romania is a country located in the southeastern part of Central Europe, along the lower course of the Danube River, north of the Balkan Peninsula, and on the northwestern shore of the Black Sea. The name Romania derives from the Latin word Romanus, meaning “citizen of Rome”; the region was an outpost of the Roman Empire in the 2nd century AD. This name was adopted in 1861, two years after the Union of the Romanian Principalities, and its choice also served to emphasize the shared Latin heritage of the three major historical regions — Wallachia, Moldavia, and Transylvania — within the context of their gradual unification, which took place between the mid-19th century and the early 20th century (a unification process preceded by the brief union of the three regions in 1600 under Michael the Brave).

                    The history of Romania conventionally refers to the history of the Romanian geographical region, the peoples who inhabited it, and the modern Romanian state. One of the most debated issues in Romanian historiography — an issue that actually reflects the path it has followed — is the question of origins. Thus, the origins of the Romanian people are disputed, with several theories existing on the subject.

                <p>
                    In 1941, as an ally of Germany, Romania entered the Second World War, declaring war on the Soviet Union. A change in the course of the war became only vaguely apparent after the defeat at Stalingrad and the shift of the USSR from defense to offense.

                    On August 23, 1944, with the Soviet army already in northern Moldova since March, King Michael I removed Marshal Ion Antonescu by force, as he refused to sign the armistice with the United Nations. Following Antonescu's firm refusal, King Michael I ordered his dismissal and arrest, and Romania switched sides to join the Allies.

                <p>
                    In the context of the fall of communism throughout Eastern Europe, a protest that began in mid-December 1989 in Timișoara quickly turned into a nationwide movement against the communist political regime, leading to the removal of Nicolae Ceaușescu from power.

                    An interim council made up of figures from civil society and former communist officials took control of the government, and Ion Iliescu became the provisional president of the country. The new government repealed many of the authoritarian communist policies and imprisoned several leaders of the former regime.

                    In May 1990, multiparty elections were held for both the legislature and the presidency. Iliescu was elected president, and his party, the National Salvation Front, gained control of the legislature. Petre Roman became prime minister. However, the elections did not put an end to the anti-government demonstrations. The miners' violent interventions led to the dismissal of the Roman government in September 1991. In October, former finance minister Theodor Stolojan succeeded Roman as prime minister and formed a new cabinet. In the 1992 national elections, Ion Iliescu won another term. With parliamentary support from the nationalist parties PUNR, PRM, and the former communist party PSM, a new government was formed in November 1992, led by Prime Minister Nicolae Văcăroiu.

                    Emil Constantinescu, from the electoral coalition Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR), defeated President Iliescu in 1996 after a second round and replaced him as head of state. Victor Ciorbea was appointed prime minister. Ciorbea remained in office until March 1998, when he was replaced by Radu Vasile, and later by Mugur Isărescu. The 2000 elections were won by the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and Ion Iliescu, with Adrian Năstase appointed as prime minister. In 2004, the elections were won by Traian Băsescu, who became President of Romania at the head of a coalition formed by the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Party (PD), alongside the UDMR and PUR. Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu was appointed prime minister.

                    Since 2004, Romania has been a member of NATO, and since 2007 it has been a member of the European Union. Following the parliamentary elections in November 2008, the Democratic Liberal Party (PD-L) won the most seats, followed by the alliance between PSD and PC, as well as PNL and UDMR. Subsequently, a coalition government was formed between PSD+PC and PD-L, led by Emil Boc. However, starting in December 2009, following a parliamentary vote, PD-L, UDMR, and the group of independents (which later became UNPR) formed the Boc II cabinet.

                    Forced to implement massive budget cuts due to the global financial crisis, the government became highly unpopular and resigned. Its successor was removed from power by Parliament in 2012 after only two months in office. Although the attempt to remove the president through a referendum that summer failed, the newly formed majority, led by PSD, imposed governments headed by Victor Ponta. After a short period with a politically neutral government, PSD returned to power following the 2016 elections, but its actions to limit and obstruct anti-corruption efforts were met with widespread street protests.
